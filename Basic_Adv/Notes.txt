Variable:
    Variables are same as container which is used to store any type of data 

Pointer:
    Pointer is a special type of variable which is used to store address of another variable.

Reference [ & ]:
    It returns the address of given variable.

De-Reference [ * ]:
    It returns the value at given address.

TYPES OF POINTER:

1. NULL Pointer:
        Pointer initialise with nullptr is called NULL Pointer.
            - it is a good practice to initialise pointer with NUll to avoid WILD Pointer.

2. VOID Pointer:
        Pointer defined using void keyword is called void pointer.

        SYNTAX: 
            void * ptr_name = NULL;

            - It is also known as generic pointer.

3. DANGLING Pointer: 
        Pointer which indicates memory which is deallocated.

4. CONSTANT Variable:
         Constant variable is defined using const keyword.
        - We cannot override the value of constant variable.
         
5. CONSTANT Pointer:
        Constant pointer is same as constant variable :
        SYNTAX:
            const data_type * ptr_name = & variable_name;


POINTER OF POINTER 
    It is also known as double pointer, used to store address of any pointer:

    SYNTAX:
        data_type ** pointer_name = & another_pointer_name;



RECURSION : 
    Recursion is a technique in which a function calls itself.


NOTE: For every constructor call, there must be constructor defined        

Destructor : It is used to destroy the object.
            - In other words, it deallocate memory allocated by constructor 


Copy Constructor: 
            - If we do not define copy constructor then the compiler define it for us


[this] keyword : 
        - (this) keyword is a constant pointer which contain the address of current object

IMPORTANT DECLARATION 


WAYS TO DECLARE METHODS 
    1. Inside class method 
    2. Outside class method 


COPY CONSTRUCTOR
Copy constructor is a special type of construct that initialises or creates a new object as a copy of an existing object.
Default Copy constructor: 
It is an automatically provided constructor by the c++ compiler.

We create variable to allocate memory space 


STRUCTURE:

Structure is a derived datatype 

FUNCTIONS : 
1 . LIBRARY FUNCTIONS 
2 . USER DEFINED FUNCTIONS 
3 . SPECIAL FUNCTIONS 

USER DEFINED FUNCTIONS : 1. ITERATIVE FUNCTIONS 
                         2. RECURSIVE FUNCTIONS 



STATIC DATA MEMBER :
            -It is defined using static keyword.
                - When static is used with data member in a class, it makes the variable shared among all instances of the class.

STATIC MEMBER FUNCTION : A static member function in C++ is a member of a class that:
                            -Belongs to the class rather than any object of the class.
                            -Can be called using the class name (without creating an object).
                            -Can access only static data members and other static member functions of the class.
                            -Cannot access this pointer because it is not tied to any instance


DOUBLY LINKED LIST:  A doubly linked list is a type of linked list in which each node contains three parts:
                        - Data – The value stored in the node.
                        -Pointer to the next node – Points to the next node in the list.
                        -Pointer to the previous node – Points to the previous node in the list.
                        -This allows bidirectional traversal: both forward and backward through the list.

Template : 
        -Template is a base of generic programming in c++.
        - Genereic Programming is a programming which is independent of any data type.


- In C++, implementation of template is peformed via two methods 
 1. Generic_Fuction
 2. Generic_Class
